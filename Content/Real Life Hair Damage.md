# Quantifying hair damage 

Dr. Ali Syed defines hair damage as “essentially any condition whereby one or more of the hair structures, (cuticles, cortex, medulla, etc.), are physically or chemically altered to the extent that they are unable to return to their original state.”

Hair Porosity  is a measure of how damaged the hair as it defined by the ability of water to enter or exit the hair and this is restricted by the integrity of the cuticle .  The current measurement of cuticle integrity cuticle abrasion whereby this is a destructive  macro measurement .

 

Syed reports that hair can become more porous  following 

Chemical treatments that lift/open the cuticle such as relaxers, or permanent colours.

Physical manipulation (brushing, combing)

Heat damage (flat ironing, blow drying)

Shampoos with a pH of 5.5 or higher

Ultraviolet light from the sun

# Measuring hair damage – porosity 

Consumers understand hair porosity and probably refer to this as dry ends .  As the longer hair has been exposed to normal styling and manipulation, the more porous it becomes. 

That’s why the ends / tips of the hair are more likely to feel dry/harder than root.

For consumers to diagnose if they have damage hair the signs are  

- Hair air-dries quickly
- Hair feels straw-like to the touch
- Hair is dry even though you moisturize/condition it often
- Hair processes chemical treatments quickly
- Hair tangles easily and is hard to detangle. It snags on itself, especially when wet.

# Measuring hair porosity   Technical advice for in home testing 

Mist Test: 

Start with clean, dry hair (air-dried, not blow-dried) with no product in it. Take a spray bottle with water and adjust the opening to create a fine mist. Hold the bottle about 8 inches away from the hair and mist. If the hair immediately soaks up the water, it may be highly porous. If water beads up on the hair then gradually soaks in, the porosity may be normal.

Strand Dip Test: 

Take a few strands of clean, dry hair and place it in a cup of room temperature water. If it sinks in less than two minutes, it may be highly porous.

Glide Test: 

Hold one or two strands of clean, dry hair between two fingers of one hand. Using the other hand, glide your fingers down the hair from root to tip. If the hair feels rough, bumpy or uneven, you might have porous hair. If it feels smooth, it may be normal.

Soak Test: 

The next time you shower, allow the water to soak your hair and take mental note of how fast it absorbs the water and gets heavy. If it immediately becomes soaked/heavy, it may be porous.

# Measuring hair porosity   Technical in vitro measures 

Dr Syed and H. Ayoub (Avlon Industries ) have reported* technical measure of hair porosity measures .  

The report validates the measure of hair porosity by using the reported weight method – by Valko and Barnett , directly with the tensile testing, upon  hair that has undergone cosmetic treatments . 

Hair measured – virgin, coloured , bleached , and relaxed hair .

They conclude that from their data the weight  method of measuring the water uptake  (hair porosity ) significantly correlates (Where r= 0.9607) to the tensile measure  of hair when hair fibres are chemically treated with various cosmetic treatments .
