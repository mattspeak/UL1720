# Porosity &amp; Elasticity

# Porosity definition

Sure! Hair porosity refers to your hair's ability to absorb and retain moisture. It's determined by the structure of your hair's cuticle, which is the outer layer of your hair. There are three main types of hair porosity:

Low Porosity: The cuticles are tightly packed and flat. This makes it difficult for moisture to penetrate the hair shaft, but once moisture is in, it stays locked in. Low porosity hair can be prone to product buildup and may take longer to dry.

Medium (Normal) Porosity: The cuticles are slightly raised, allowing for a balanced amount of moisture to enter and exit the hair shaft. This type of hair usually requires the least maintenance and responds well to most hair care products.

High Porosity: The cuticles are raised or even damaged, making it easy for moisture to enter but also to escape. High porosity hair can be prone to frizz and dryness and may benefit from more intensive moisturizing treatments.

Understanding your hair porosity can help you choose the right products and treatments to keep your hair healthy and manageable. Do you know what type of porosity your hair has?

Porosity 

Sarah Golding CTI Insights from

 Curly hair training courses.

Low porosity: Cuticles that are close together and overlapping. "Low porosity hair is resistant to absorbing and losing water and water-based products bead on top of the hair fibre versus penetrating the hair fibre. ​

This is where a clarifying or exfoliating shampoo comes in. "Alkaline ingredients will open the cuticle to make absorption easier; acidic closes the cuticle allows humectants and moisture to penetrate the hair fibre deeper, giving the hair more elasticity, softness, and shine. Hair wont feel great post shampoo however once conditioner is applied the positives will return.​

Avoid most oil-based products and look for more moisture-based products so that the ingredients don’t just sit atop the hair. Natural glycerine, lanolin, avocado, jojoba, and shea are all ingredients that offer loads of moisture. Avoid too much protein or heavy oils as they can sit on the hair and not absorb. ​

"To help with absorption, condition hair when wet and/or apply some heat/steamer (liquid, cream, oil LCO). "First, apply water or a water-based product, followed by a cream to seal and moisturize ends, and finish it with a natural oil."

Medium porosity:

 Cuticles that are less tightly bound, they are half-way open, which means that moisture can reach inside the hair shaft quite easily, but at the same time it is not lost too quickly. It’s the easiest porosity type to manage. It’s important to remember though that with heat, bleaching or colouring the hair gets damaged and the porosity can change overtime.

When you spray some water on a clean, product-free strand, the water will form some beads but then easily sink into the hair. The hair is easy to manage and style. The hair gets wet easily. It doesn’t take too long to dry the hair. The hair takes and holds colour quite easily but it doesn’t stain with semi-permanent dyes

How to care for this hair type:

Clarify frequently, frequent use moisturizing and strengthening hair treatments, use lightweight products, protein containing products can be used.

Bond Curl Rehab Salve: Use every 3-4 wash days to reduce breakage and protect from further damage.

Double Cream Deep Quencher: Use every week to maintain good moisture levels.

For the LCO method, consider using a glycerin-based spritz, followed by Shea, Mango, or Aloe butter, and then an oil like Grapeseed or Safflower oil to keep your hair moisturized

High porosity: Cuticles that are more widely spaced.

High porosity hair, which absorbs water quickly but has trouble retaining moisture. The hair can appear frizzy, feel dry and is fragile. Often the top section that has more sun damage, heat appliance damage etc.

Products that are both oil and cream-based are typically better than gels or water-based products because they can seal into the hair and help the hair retain the moisture. Cream-based oils.

The LOC method liquid or leave-in, oil, then cream.

Coconut oil, castor oil, avocado oil, and shea butter are just a few good ingredients for this hair type.

Avoiding products with high alcohol content, also the use of clarifying shampoos as they may be too drying on the hair. 

Hair porosity refers to your hair’s ability to absorb and retain moisture. It affects how well oils and moisture pass in and out of the outermost layer of your hair. Water will bead and not soak in on dry hair.​ The regimes for different hair porosity are key and a gap.
