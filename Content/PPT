The Strand-Out Insights:
Porosity is not just a trend—it's a behavioural shift
Consumers are beginning to treat porosity like a skin concern: something to diagnose, manage, and treat through multi-step regimes. This opens the door for Unilever to build deeper engagement through conditioning and styling routines that mirror skincare logic.
Porosity is emerging as a new way of talking about damage
It is reframing the conversation - moving beyond breakage, split ends and bonding to a more holistic, science-led and skincare inspired understanding of hair health.

BONUS FEATURE: AN INTERVIEW WITH OUR STYLIST TEAM
We spoke with Jess, Sarah and Kate—members of our stylist team with over 45 years of combined experience. Read to see how hair porosity shapes everything for stylists from product choice to styling longevity, and see why stylist expertise is essential to grooming our science in real-world hair experiences.
Please note, this is a view of porosity from a stylist's POV.
What is hair porosity?
"Porosity is how quickly hair absorbs and releases moisture. We see it most clearly with toners—porous hair grabs colour fast but loses it just as quickly."
What influences porosity?
"Heat damage, over-processing, and lack of protection. Textured hair tends to be naturally more porous than straight hair."
How do stylists test porosity?
"We do strand tests—pulling gently to check elasticity. If it stretches like chewing gum, it's porous and fragile. If it resists, it's stronger."
What do clients hear in consultations?
"We don't always say 'porosity'—we talk about dryness or damage. But we tailor advice to help build condition and protect the cuticle."
What are signs of Low vs High Porosity?
"Low porosity hair looks shiny and sleek, holds style well, and feels healthy. High porosity hair struggles to hold style, feels dry or brittle, and often shows signs of damage."
Does porosity affect product choice?
"We use Climazone to open cuticles with masks, then rinse with cool water to seal them. Porosity guides whether we use bond builders like Olaplex or K18"
Does porosity shape treatment decisions?
"Post-colour treatments like Wella's pH balancer help restore the hair. We always treat porous hair before colouring to prevent colour loss."
Anymore stylist insights?
"Porous hair grabs colour unevenly, especially at the ends. We adjust our approach—toners after bleach help even things out."

Activate With Purpose
Porosity & Styling (TRESemmé)
Tresemmé has the authority to reframe porosity as a pre-styling foundation and a styling-led, education-driven opportunity. Routed in salon expertise the brand can connect care, technology, and styling through a regime where wash and care lay the groundwork for enhanced and transformative styling outcomes.
PREP: Rebalance fibre porosity & infuse moisture to prime the hair
SEAL: Seal & resurface the hair during styling to shield the cuticle and lock in the infused moisture.
FINISH: Preserve the finish & extend the look for X days
Porosity & Curls (Sunsilk)
Sunsilk's brand essence has permission to activate porosity through a curl & waves lens. Porosity is a key challenge for curly hair—they lose moisture, frizz easily, and struggle to maintain their shape. Sunsilk can tap into the already established routine of improving porosity.
L - Liquid: Mist conditioners or water-based serums can be positioned as the first step to saturate and soften the fibre.
O - Oil: Position oils to seal the cuticle to prevent moisture loss and add shine & protection without greasiness.
C - Cream: Creams provide hold, definition, and long-lasting softness. Sunsilk's curl custards and butters can be framed as the final LOC step.

From Trend to Tech | The R&D Response
Porosity may be trending in the outside world, but inside Hair R&D—we're testing it.
Whilst consumers are decoding their hair's moisture behaviour with float tests and TikTok videos, Hair R&D is decoding it with lasers, lipid chemistry, and diffusion coefficients.
Using the DSM instrument at MIF (image on the right), Hair R&D are measuring how hair fibres swell when immersed in water. By tracking the rate of this swelling, we can gain insight into how porous a hair fibre really is. Importantly, the rate of swelling gives us a way to quantify what consumers are already describing: how quickly their hair absorbs and loses moisture.
So, how do we improve it?
We've been putting hair through its paces: basewashes, hexane soaks, even chloroform-methanol cocktails (don't try this at home). The more we strip out lipids, the more porous the fibre becomes. But, once we bring those lipids back with a coconut oil emulsion, the fibre bounces back & porosity drops!
The people behind the science
Paul Carpenter and the MIF team are leading the porosity response, with support from our fibre and formulation experts. Together, they're turning porosity from a consumer curiosity into a measurable & claimable benefit for future products.

COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE
The porosity conversation is evolving... and our competitors are responding with precision.
L'Oréal is leading the charge with a multi-benefit strategy that spans metal detox, repair and colour variants. With each range tackling porosity from a different angle. No longer is porous hair just a technical detail, but it is now a consumer-facing claim platform. From Metal Detox's pre-shampoo filler to Vitamino's vibrancy lock, porosity is being positioned as the root cause of fade, frizz, and damage.
The messaging is clear: treat porosity, protect colour, preserve shine & strength.
Other brands such as Umberto Giannini, Cantu and CurlSmith are also exploring the high porosity space for textured hair.
For R&D and brand teams, the message is clear: porosity is no longer a technical or salon niche—it's a strategic claim space.

TREND STATS & SOCIAL MEDIA
Haircare that is reshaping routines
Hair porosity is having a moment—and it's not just a niche science term anymore. From TikTok tutorials to ingredient breakdowns, porosity is now a key lens through which Gen Z and Millennial consumers are decoding their hair needs. The hashtag #hairporosity has surpassed 79 million views on TikTok, whilst Google Trends shows 'Porosity' searches continues to increase from 2022. We're also seeing a rise of searches for porosity in relation to mask formats, with consumers owning the conversation on masks for low vs high porosity hair.

Why now?
This trend is riding the wave of ingredient literacy, routine personalisation, and a growing demand for functional beauty. In a post-skinimalism era, consumers are asking not just what works, but why—and porosity offers answers. Whether it's clarifying for low porosity or sealing for high, creators are turning porosity into a diagnostic tool, not just a buzzword.
It's also deeply visual. From the viral "float test" as a measure of porosity, to ultra-satisfying product layering routines, porosity content taps into the same dopamine loop as heatless curls: education, transformation and reveal. And in a time where cost-of-living pressures meet high-performance expectations, porosity may be a way that consumers are looking to optimise without overspending.

WHAT IS POROSITY?
Porosity isn't a hair type - it's a hair behaviour
Hair porosity refers to how readily your hair retains and absorbs moisture. Some strands can have higher porosity, which makes them behave like a thirsty sponge. Whilst others can have lower porosity, which makes the fibre repel water like a raincoat. Porosity is governed by the structure of the hair cuticle—the overlapping cuticles that form the outer layer of each strand. These cuticles can be tightly sealed, slightly raised or wide open. Porosity is influenced by genetics... but it can also be influenced by chemical treatments, heat styling and environmental exposure - therefore, porosity isn't something that stays consistent over your life, it can change over time.
Lower Porosity Hair
Low porosity hair has cuticles that are tightly compact. It resists moisture & product penetration because of the tightly closed structure. Because of this, low porosity consumers will often say they have product build up or greasy hair and hairdressers describe it as 'resistant'.
Higher Porosity Hair
High porosity hair has lifted cuticles, allowing moisture and products to penetrate quickly, it also means that it loses them just as fast. Because of this, high porosity consumers will often say they have 'dry', 'rough hair'.

An Introduction
To understand where latest buzzword in the haircare world came from, we need to rewind back to a time when porosity wasn't a TikTok Hashtag...
Back in the 1990s and early 2000s, porosity wasn't part of consumer vocabulary. But hairdressers were taught the concept during training, and understood that how your hair absorbed and retained moisture could make or break a colour or a perm. They didn't always call it "porosity" to clients—instead, they'd say your hair was "dry", "damaged" and "resistant", and would use products to alleviate the problem prior to applying chemical treatments.
In fact, porosity was the unsung science behind one of the most iconic 90's films: Legally Blonde. When Elle Woods catches Chutney in a lie for showering right after a perm, she's actually invoking porosity logic. After a perm, hair can be highly porous—meaning if water is applied it can interfere with the newly formed bonds the perm has created.
The textured hair community—particularly consumers with Type 3 and 4 curls—played a pivotal role in bringing porosity into the spotlight. In the 2000s and 2010s, online forums, YouTube channels and blogs began to educate and share knowledge, especially on the nature of curly hair. Understanding whether hair was low, medium or high porosity became just as important as knowing your curl type. Now it wasn't just about how your hair looked, it was about how it behaves too.
Now in the 2020s, porosity is beginning to enter the mainstream. It's being talked about across all hair types online as consumers look for more personalised ways to understand their hair. And it's not just digital chatter: porosity is starting to show up on shelf too, with brands incorporating it into product claims, packaging, and even diagnostic tools. What was once a behind-the-scenes concept is now a front-of-pack feature.
