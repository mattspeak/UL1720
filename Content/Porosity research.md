Definition of porosity

&amp; how it presents

# Why porosity matters for hair care

Moisture Retention &amp; Absorption

- Determines how easily hair takes in and holds moisture, impacting hydration strategies.
- Guides whether to use lightweight formulas, sealing oils, or protein treatments.
- High porosity often signals chemical or mechanical damage, requiring strengthening and bond-building products.
- High porosity hair absorbs colour quickly but fades faster; low porosity resists penetration, needing longer processing or heat.
- High porosity hair frizzes in humidity; low porosity can feel heavy with rich products.
- Influences how products layer (e.g., LOC/LCO methods) for lasting definition and shine.
- Helps tailor care for climate-specific challenges (e.g., humid regions like Indonesia).

High absorbency but also quickly looses moisture

Hair Porosity &amp; Texture

Hair type strongly influences porosity:

Straight, untreated hair → usually low porosity (smooth, sleek, high shine).

Wavy &amp; curly hair → tends toward medium to high porosity (absorbs moisture but may lose it quickly).m

Consumer impact:

Straight hair often shows flyaways &amp; frizz.

Curly hair can show patchy shine and lack of curl definition.

Looking at Porosity when dry

- Low porosity hair types share common characteristics, such as a smoother appearance when air-dried and increased difficulty in styling. When blow-dried, this hair type tends to look slightly heavier. Additionally, low porosity hair is prone to product buildup, resulting in a greasy, coated look and feel. You can use heat to help products penetrate e.g. warm up with a steamer, heat cap, or warm towel when using deep conditioning or applying leave-ins. Lightweight products are generally a better choice for managing this hair type. 
- In comparison high porosity hair all have a frizzy dry brittle look when left to natural dry. The use of reduced heat styling combined with correct products to add moisture and restore the cuticle layer instantly visually improves overall finished look. Products should be used as part of a regime over time to benefit and restore hair.

|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Moisture & Product Absorption      | Porosity determines how easily hair absorbs and retains moisture and products.                                  | - High Porosity: Hair absorbs chemicals quickly, increasing risk of over-processing (colour, relaxers, perms).- Low Porosity: Resistant to penetration, requiring longer processing times or heat assistance. |
| Hair Type Differences              | Straight hair often shows porosity through shine and smoothness; curly hair shows it through frizz and dryness. | - Curly/4c hair with high porosity can become fragile during chemical services.- Straight hair with low porosity may need pre-treatment for even colour uptake.                                               |
| Color Services                     | Porosity affects how color molecules enter and stay in the hair shaft.                                          | - High Porosity: Color grabs fast but fades quickly.- Low Porosity: Color may not take evenly without lifting the cuticle.                                                                                    |
| Texture Services (Perms, Relaxers) | Porosity influences how bonds break and reform.                                                                 | - High porosity hair can over-process and lose elasticity.- Low porosity hair may need stronger formulations or longer timing.                                                                                |
| Damage Risk                        | High porosity often signals previous damage (heat, bleach), making hair more vulnerable.                        | Hairdresser must adjust chemical strength and timing to avoid breakage.                                                                                                                                        |

Key takeaway for hairdressers: Porosity isn’t just about moisture it’s a predictor of chemical behavior. 

Knowing a client’s porosity helps you choose the right products, adjust processing times, 

and prevent damage, ensuring results are even and long-lasting.

# Chemical treatments 

Key Principles

- Low Porosity: Resistant to chemicals → needs heat or alkaline pre-treatment.
- Medium Porosity: Most adaptable → can handle chemical treatments with proper care.
- High Porosity: Already fragile → chemical treatments should be minimized or avoided.

# Insights 

Absorbency of conditioner

Visual and tactile residue

Smooth appearance

Heat helping the products to penetrate 

For some porosity types light weight is better

Heat and mechanical damage, reduce this and demonstrate the results

Feel, flexibility of hair, smoother, higher alignment

Steaming and porosity

Easier styling, shaping

- Videos to demonstrate:
- Low porous hair repels, water runs off the hair and droplets don’t absorb.
- 
- High porous hair absorbs the water faster, droplets soak into the hair and droplets don’t run down the hair as much .

Demos 

Float Test

- DBE low porosity hair sits on the surface of water .
- Bleached damaged high porosity hair strand sinks to the bottom.

Water droplet test

- Low porous hair repels, water runs off the hair and droplets don’t absorb.
- 
- High porous hair absorbs the water faster, droplets soak into the hair and droplets don’t run down the hair as much .

Indian hair porosity equaliser

- Video shows that 
- 

Using a regime improves the porosity of hair.

It reducing tangles during lathering and rinsing. Which cues less damage and breakage.

The leave conditioners helps with detangling

Adding further lightweight moisture to the hair

Styling hair is easier, with light slip and control.

Dry phase hair is smoother, flexible bouncy and soft.

# Demo ideas

Treat and maintain coloured hair. Demo smooth aligned hair.

To a consumer porosity would manifest as: dull, brittle, none flexible hair, not aligned, not defined, hair that dry’s quick and absorbs product quickly

How do we demo this? Or show in images, then we can say what we need to use to fix this, higher conditioning, less heat,

Visual differences in porosity through craftsman testing 

From an expert point of view applying a hair mask/ deep conditioning treatment will allow the difference in porosity to be shown for demonstration purposes.

To research this we used a variation of own brand vs. competitor's products. Following craftsman protocol to assess the best noticeable differences, through multiple hair types. 

<!-- image -->

Fine Low porosity 

Heat damaged High porosity 

Insights &amp;Findings 

Low Porosity - Mask Sits heavier on surface, taking longer to absorb. Leaves a hair with a heavier wet coated feel/look.

High Porosity – Absorbs quickly, leaving minimal visual residue. No residue in hands. 

<!-- image -->

Comparing Type 1 hair for porosity levels

Applying conditioner

DBE virgin hair low porosity

- Instant visual residue, Low absorption.  product sits heavier on hair, giving a slippery/slimy coated feel. Hair feels weighted with a wetter look. 
- Hair acts like a sponge with high absorption. Minimal visual residue on hair and in hands.

Chinese hair Low/moderate  porosity

4B-4C Curly High Porosity

Molecular bonding in hair care can help porosity 

Demo to show using Oplaplex number 8 mask on Chinese hair and Curly 4b/c

- Repairs and fills in gaps in the hair cuticle, reducing moisture loss and improving product absorption. 
- Smooths the cuticle, enhancing shine, manageability, and reducing frizz. 
- Strengthens hair structure, improving elasticity and resilience. 
- 

Insights and findings 

Product looked heavy and weighted on Chinese hair, hair was clumped and separated while distributing. Wet coated look with residue. 

In comparison 4b hair instantly showed High porosity. The hair initially acted like a barrier with water beading off hair taking longer to fully saturate the hair. On application product instantly clings &amp; absorbs but may also struggle to retain moisture on this hair type.

Float test

- 
- Low porosity  Hair with a tightly bound cuticle layer that makes it difficult for moisture to penetrate the hair shaft. Low porosity hair tends to repel water and products, but it retains moisture well once moisturized.
- 
- Medium Hair with a slightly open cuticle layer that allows a moderate amount of moisture to penetrate the hair shaft. This type of hair, also known as normal porosity hair, is generally healthy, easy to maintain, and responds well to most hair care products and treatments
- 
- High Porosity Hair with a damaged or open cuticle layer that allows for excessive moisture to penetrate the hair shaft and makes it difficult for the hair to retain the moisture. High porosity hair is often frizzy, dry, and brittle and can result from damage to the hair cuticle layer due to excessive heat styling, bleaching, and other chemical processes.
- 
- Hair porosity testing can help determine the condition of the hair’s cuticle structure. Porosity level classification (low, medium, or high). The strength and elasticity of the hair. Which are the best products to use. How often to wash the hair and the appropriate haircare routine required.
- 

Hair porosity refers to the amount of space between the cuticles of the hair shaft. It is a characteristic that determines how well the hair can absorb and retain moisture and nutrients from Chemicals and hair products.

Effect of styling equipment

The Role of Hair Porosity in Styling

Ever wonder why your style or curls don’t hold like they used to?

 It might not be the technique it’s likely your hair porosity. Choosing products based on porosity-specific needs because your hair’s ability to absorb and retain moisture directly impacts how it styles, holds, and responds to product. 

The market in hair styling equipment is on the move​, knowing your porosity is a styling game-changer. Brands are competing in the market, offering;

- Controlled heat, resulting in healthier hair with less breakage.​
- Enhanced Hair Health: Smart heat control maintains hair's natural moisture and shine, resulting in smoother, shinier hair.
- Faster styling reduces time combined with easier styling leading to longer-lasting, high-quality styles.​

# Chemical treatments 

# Myth busting

1. Myth Busting: Is hair porosity influenced by genetic hair texture, such as hair texture type?

- Partially true. Genetics influence both hair texture and cuticle structure, which can affect porosity. For example: 
- Type 4 or 3 hair often has higher porosity because bends in the strand lift the cuticle.
- Straight hair tends to have lower porosity because the cuticle lies flat. However, porosity is not fixed by texture alone environmental and styling &amp; chemical factors play a big role.
- 
- 
- Chemical treatments (bleaching, colouring, relaxers) → increase porosity permanently.
- Heat styling (high heat without protection) → raises cuticle, increases porosity.
- Protein treatments → temporarily fill gaps, making hair behave like lower porosity. (they can make the hair brittle with over use)
- pH-balanced products → help smooth cuticle, reducing porosity temporarily. So, porosity can be managed, but not fully reversed without structural changes.
- Using a regime bespoke for hair type, length, texture, styling method &amp; desired end look can help to manage porosity in a positive way
- 
- 
- Low porosity: Resistant to moisture, prone to buildup → needs lightweight products.
- Medium porosity: Balanced → easiest to maintain.
- High porosity: Absorbs moisture quickly but loses it fast → needs sealing and repair. The goal is not to change porosity, but to adapt care to your porosity type.
- 
- 

2. Changeable Porosity: Can hair porosity be altered by using certain products (what types of treatments can change hair porosity)?

Yes, but only temporarily. Porosity changes mainly through damage or treatment, not regular products: 

3. Porosity Value Judgment: Does high porosity mean bad and low porosity mean good?

No. Neither is inherently “good” or “bad.” Each porosity level has pros and cons: 

Expert recommendations 

Expert recommendations for Porous hair

For low porosity hair, which tends to resist moisture and chemical absorption, hairdressers typically recommend a tailored approach both before and after colouring to ensure even results and minimise damage. 

Pre-Colour Recommendations Clarifying Treatment (2–3 days before colouring) Use a clarifying or chelating shampoo to remove product build-up and mineral deposits. This helps open the cuticle slightly and allows colour to penetrate more evenly 

Porosity Equaliser or Protein-Rich Primer Apply a porosity equaliser or a protein-rich pre-colour treatment to balance the hair’s porosity. This ensures the dye distributes evenly and prevents patchy results .

1. Heat-Assisted Deep Conditioning Before colouring, use a deep conditioning treatment with gentle heat (e.g. under a shower cap with a hairdryer on low) to soften the cuticle and improve moisture retention 
2.  Scalp Protection Some stylists use pre-colour serums or scalp protectants to shield sensitive skin from irritation, especially if bleach is involved 
3. Cool Water Rinse Rinse with cool water to help seal the cuticle and lock in colour.
4. Moisture-Rich Conditioner or Mask Follow up with a moisturising conditioner or a colour-safe hair mask to replenish hydration and maintain elasticity.
5. Avoid Sulphates and Heat Use sulphate-free shampoos and minimise heat styling to preserve colour and prevent dryness.

Post-Colour Care

Expert recommendations for medium Porous hair

For medium porosity hair, which naturally absorbs and retains moisture well, hairdressers typically recommend a balanced approach to maintain its optimal condition before and after colouring. 

Pre-Colour : Porosity Equalising Primer

Use a pre-colour treatment like Aloxxi COLOURPRIME® or similar products. These help equalise porosity, ensuring even colour uptake and reducing the risk of patchy results 1.

Moisture-Protein Balance

Medium porosity hair benefits from maintaining a balance between moisture and protein. A light protein-based conditioner (e.g. ORS Replenishing Conditioner) before colouring can strengthen the hair without making it brittle 2.

Gentle Cleansing

Cleanse the hair with a mild, sulphate-free shampoo to remove build-up without stripping natural oils. This helps the colour adhere better.

Post-Colour Care

Hydrating Conditioner or Mask

Use a moisturising, colour-safe conditioner or deep treatment to replenish hydration and seal the cuticle.

Lightweight Oils

Seal in moisture with light oils like grapeseed, sweet almond, or safflower oil. These won’t weigh the hair down or cause build-up 2.

Avoid Over-Processing

Since medium porosity hair can shift toward high porosity with excessive heat or chemical use, limit heat styling and use heat protectants when necessary.

Expert recommendations for Highly Porous hair

For high porosity hair, which has lifted or damaged cuticles that absorb colour quickly but also lose it just as fast, hairdressers typically recommend a protective and restorative approach both before and after colouring. 

Pre-Colour Recommendations: Protein Treatment or Porosity Filler

Use a protein-rich pre-colour treatment to temporarily fill in gaps in the cuticle. This helps create a smoother surface for even colour absorption and reduces the risk of patchy results 1 2.

Avoid Overlapping Colour

If you're doing a root touch-up or reapplication, avoid overlapping onto previously coloured hair to prevent over-processing and breakage 1.

Professional Application

High porosity hair is more prone to uneven results, so a professional colourist can help apply the dye more evenly and use techniques that minimise damage 1.

Post-Colour Care

Sulfate-Free, Colour-Safe Products

Use gentle, colour-protecting shampoos and conditioners to prevent premature fading 1.

Cold Water Rinses

Rinse with cold water after washing to help seal the cuticle and lock in colour 1.

Deep Conditioning Treatments

Regular deep conditioning helps restore moisture and elasticity, which is especially important for porous hair 1.

Limit Heat and UV Exposure

Use heat protectants when styling and consider UV-protective sprays or hats to prevent colour fade from sun exposure 1.

Wash Less Frequently

Reduce washing frequency to help preserve the colour. When you do wash, use lukewarm or cool water 1.

 Key Insight:

- Western Indonesia (straight/wavy hair) → lightweight, anti-frizz, buildup prevention. 
- 
- Eastern Indonesia (wavy/curly hair) → sealing oils, humidity-blocking gels, protective styles. 
- Nusa Tenggara (moderate humidity) → balanced hydration, occasional heat styling.

# UV effect on hair

UV radiation primarily damages hair by breaking down its structural proteins and pigments. 

Protein Degradation: UV light breaks down keratin, weakening the hair shaft and making it more brittle.

Colour Fading: UV oxidizes melanin, leading to lighter or duller colour (especially noticeable in dyed hair).

Lipid Loss: It strips natural oils from the cuticle, reducing shine and flexibility.

Cuticle Erosion: Prolonged exposure lifts or cracks the cuticle, increasing porosity and frizz.

Impact by Porosity Level

Low Porosity

Characteristics: Tight cuticle, resists moisture.

UV Effect: Cuticle is harder to penetrate, so internal damage is slower. However, surface oxidation can still cause dullness and stiffness.

Risk: Build-up of UV-protective products may occur because low porosity resists absorption.

 Medium Porosity

Characteristics: Balanced moisture flow.

UV Effect: More vulnerable than low porosity because cuticle is slightly raised. UV can degrade internal proteins and pigments faster.

Risk: Noticeable dryness and colour fading with prolonged exposure.

High Porosity

Characteristics: Gaps in cuticle, absorbs and loses moisture easily.

UV Effect: Most vulnerable. UV penetrates deeply, accelerating protein breakdown and lipid loss. Hair becomes brittle, frizzy, and fades quickly.

Risk: High moisture loss and structural weakening.
