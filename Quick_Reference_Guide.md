## One-Page Cheat Sheet

## The 3-Second Explanation

**Hair Porosity = How well hair absorbs and holds moisture**

- **LOW** = Resists moisture (water beads up)
- **MEDIUM** = Balanced (normal absorption)
- **HIGH** = Absorbs fast but can't hold it (very thirsty hair)

---

## Fast Identification Guide

### ASK CUSTOMERS:

1. **"How long does your hair take to dry?"**
   - Long time = LOW
   - Normal time = MEDIUM
   - Very fast = HIGH

2. **"Do you have frizz issues?"**
   - No, but feels heavy = LOW
   - Sometimes = MEDIUM
   - Constantly = HIGH

3. **"How does your hair feel?"**
   - Smooth, slippery = LOW
   - Normal = MEDIUM
   - Dry, rough = HIGH

## Key Ingredients Quick Guide

### LOW POROSITY Needs:
- Aloe vera
- Light oils (argan, grapeseed, jojoba)
- Water-based formulas
- **AVOID:** Heavy butters, too much protein

### MEDIUM POROSITY Needs:
- Balanced moisture
- Light proteins (silk, rice)
- Moderate oils
- **AVOID:** Extremes - keep it balanced

### HIGH POROSITY Needs:
- Shea butter
- Heavy oils (coconut, avocado, castor)
- Proteins (keratin)
- **AVOID:** Harsh sulfates, high alcohol

## The LOC vs LCO Method

### LOC (for HIGH porosity - dry, frizzy hair)
1. **L**iquid (water or leave-in)
2. **O**il (seal the moisture IN)
3. **C**ream (add definition)

**Why:** Oil locks moisture in before cream

### LCO (for LOW/MEDIUM porosity)
1. **L**iquid (water or leave-in)
2. **C**ream (helps moisture penetrate)
3. **O**il (light seal without weight)

**Why:** Cream helps absorption, then seal lightly

---

## Climate Considerations

### HUMID CLIMATE (like Indonesia):
- **Low Porosity:** Anti-frizz, lightweight, avoid humectants
- **Medium Porosity:** Humidity-blocking stylers
- **High Porosity:** Heavy sealants to block external moisture

### DRY CLIMATE:
- **All Types:** UV protection, extra moisture

---

## Conversation Starters

**When customer mentions dryness:**
"Let me ask - does your hair dry quickly or slowly after washing? That tells us about your hair's porosity and helps us find products that actually work."

**When customer is browsing:**
"Can I help you find something specific? If you can tell me whether your hair gets frizzy easily or if products seem to build up, I can point you to exactly what you need."

**When product isn't working:**
"It sounds like that product might not match your hair's porosity type. Some hair resists moisture and some absorbs too much - let's figure out which you have."

---

## Simple Home Tests Customers Can Try

### Water Spray Test:
Spray clean, dry hair with water
- Beads up = LOW
- Absorbs gradually = MEDIUM
- Soaks in instantly = HIGH

### Float Test:
Drop clean hair strand in water, wait 2-4 min
- Floats = LOW
- Floats then sinks = MEDIUM
- Sinks fast = HIGH

### Touch Test:
Run fingers down dry strand
- Very smooth = LOW
- Normal texture = MEDIUM
- Rough/bumpy = HIGH

## Red Flags - When to Refer to Professional

- Excessive hair loss or breakage
- Scalp pain or irritation
- Sudden dramatic texture changes
- Severe chemical damage

**Say:** "I'd recommend seeing a professional hairdresser or dermatologist for this - they can give you specialized treatment."

---

## Common Myths to Bust

**Myth:** "High porosity is bad, low porosity is good"
**Truth:** Neither is bad! They just need different care.

**Myth:** "Expensive products work better"
**Truth:** The RIGHT product for your porosity works better.

**Myth:** "More conditioner fixes everything"
**Truth:** High porosity needs sealing methods, not just more product.

**Myth:** "Porosity never changes"
**Truth:** Damage, treatments, and age can all increase porosity.

## Your 3-Step Success Formula

1. **LISTEN:** What are they complaining about?
2. **IDENTIFY:** Match complaints to porosity signs
3. **RECOMMEND:** Suggest products for that porosity type

**Follow up:** "Let me know how it works! We can adjust if needed."

---

## Remember:

- Start with questions, not assumptions
- Low porosity = lighten up
- Medium porosity = balanced approach
- High porosity = seal and protect
- When unsure, start with medium porosity products
- Build trust by explaining WHY you're recommending something
